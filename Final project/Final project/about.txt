In this project, we will build a Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) based on the model that some developers at Google recently launched (Google Lightweight MMM). It is a package that helps advertisers easily build Bayesian MMM models by providing the functionality to appropriately scale data, evaluate models, optimise budget allocations and plot common graphs used in the field. 

More info about Google Lightweight MMM: https://github.com/google/lightweight_mmm

In order to build the model, we will use a dataset found in Kaggle that contains the marketing spend per Adgroupl, the revenue and media metrics between November 2021 and January 2022. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=advertising

Steps in the project:

1. Read the documentation of Google Lightweight MMM
2. Choose a dataset.
3. Understand and clean the dataset.
4. Start with the modelling (coding)
5. Prepare presentation

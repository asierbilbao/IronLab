    "In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. You can follow the steps listed here to get the data locally: [Sakila sample database - installation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html). You can work with two sql query files - `sakila-schema.sql` (creates the schema) + `sakila-data.sql` which inserts the data.\n",

    "4. Select one column from a table and alias it. Get unique list of film languages under the alias `language`. Note that we are not asking you to obtain the language per each film, but this is a good time to think about how you might get that information in the future.\n",
